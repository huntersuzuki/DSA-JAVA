Exception handling in Java is a mechanism to manage run-time errors, ensuring normal application flow even when unexpected events (exceptions) disrupt the execution. Here's a detailed explanation:[1][5]

## What Is an Exception?
An **exception** in Java is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. It can happen due to reasons like invalid user input, arithmetic errors (e.g., division by zero), file handling issues, network problems, or hardware failures.[5][1]

## Exception Handling Mechanism
Java provides a robust exception handling mechanism using five main keywords: `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, and `finally`:[2][1][5]

### `try`
The `try` block contains code that might throw exceptions. You place risky code here, such as file operations or code that may cause arithmetic errors.

### `catch`
A `catch` block follows a `try` block. It handles exceptions thrown by the `try` block. Each `catch` block specifies a type of exception it can handle.

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0; // May throw ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("An arithmetic exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

### `finally`
The `finally` block always executes after the `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or handled. It's typically used for cleanup actions (closing files, releasing resources).

```java
finally {
    System.out.println("Finally block executed");
}
```

### `throw`
The `throw` keyword allows you to explicitly throw an exception from your code.

```java
throw new ArithmeticException("Explicitly thrown exception");
```

### `throws`
The `throws` keyword appears in method signatures, declaring that a method might throw certain exceptions, which must be handled elsewhere.

```java
void riskyMethod() throws IOException {
    // Code that may throw IOException
}
```

## Multiple and Nested Exception Handling
- **Multiple catch blocks:** You can use several catch blocks after a single try, each catching a specific type of exception.
- **Nested try-catch:** You can nest try-catch blocks to manage exceptions at different levels within a program.[1]

## How the JVM Handles Exceptions
1. If an exception occurs inside a method, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) creates an exception object containing error details and the program’s state.
2. The JVM searches the call stack for an appropriate catch block to handle the exception.
3. If an appropriate handler is found, it passes control to that block.
4. If not, the JVM’s default handler prints the error and terminates the program abnormally.[3][1]

## Example: Division by Zero
```java
try {
    int ans = 10 / 0;
    System.out.println("Answer: " + ans);
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Program continues after handling the exception.");
}
```
Output:
```
Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
Program continues after handling the exception.
```
The code continues execution after handling the exception due to the `finally` block.[5][1]

## Advantages of Exception Handling
- Maintains program flow by handling run-time errors gracefully
- Separates error-handling code from regular logic
- Provides meaningful error reporting and debugging information
- Categorizes errors by type

## Exception vs. Error
| Error | Exception |
|-------|-----------|
| Indicates serious problems, not usually handled by applications (e.g., OutOfMemoryError) | Conditions that applications might want to catch (e.g., IOException) |

## Summary Table of Keywords

| Keyword  | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| try      | Wraps code that might throw an exception |
| catch    | Handles specific exception types thrown from try |
| finally  | Executes cleanup code, always runs after try/catch |
| throw    | Explicitly throws an exception |
| throws   | Declares exceptions a method may throw |

Exception handling is a vital part of writing robust Java applications, making them fault-tolerant and reliable.[3][1][5]
