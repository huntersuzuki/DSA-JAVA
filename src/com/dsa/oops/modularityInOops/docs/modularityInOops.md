This Java code demonstrates the concept of **modularity** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by separating data and behavior into a reusable `Person` class and then creating multiple independent objects from it.[1]

## What Is Modularity in OOP?

Modularity means designing a program by dividing it into distinct, interchangeable, and manageable units or modules. In OOP, classes serve as modular building blocks that encapsulate properties (fields) and behaviors (methods). This makes code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.[1]

## How This Code Demonstrates Modularity

### 1. Class as a Module

- The `Person` class groups **related data** (fields `name` and `age`) with **related behaviors** (methods `speak` and `walk`).
- This module can be reused to create any number of `Person` objects without rewriting the logic.[1]

### 2. Multiple Independent Objects

- In `main`, two `Person` objects are created: `pranay` and `manisha`.
- Each object stores its own **independent data** using the same modular template.
- For example:
    - `pranay.name = "Pranay"`
    - `manisha.name = "Manisha"`
- Despite sharing the same class/module, the objects behave separately and maintain their own state.

### 3. Encapsulated Behavior

- The `speak` method prints text personalized with the person’s name.
- The `walk` method prints a message using the person’s name.
- Each object calls these behaviors, demonstrating modular and reusable code.

### Execution Flow Summary

- `pranay.speak("Hey I am learning Java DSA");`
    - Prints: `Pranay : Hey I am learning Java DSA`
- `manisha.speak("Oh wow that's great ");`
    - Prints: `Manisha : Oh wow that's great`
- `manisha.walk();`
    - Prints: `Manisha is able to walk !!`

### Benefits of Modularity Here

- **Reusability:** `Person` class is a reusable module for representing any person.
- **Maintainability:** Changes to `Person` behavior happen in one place (the class).
- **Clarity:** Code is organized logically separating data and methods.
- **Independent Instances:** Each `Person` object operates independently without interference.

## Summary Table

| Concept          | Code Example                         | Explanation                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Modularity       | `class Person { ... }`              | Class as a reusable module for persons |
| Encapsulation    | Fields and methods inside `Person` | Bundles related data and behavior   |
| Multiple Objects | `pranay`, `manisha`                 | Independent persons created from the same module |
| Reusability      | Methods `speak` and `walk`          | Behaviors reused by all objects     |

This code exemplifies modularity in OOP as it creates a well-defined unit (`Person` class) that can be reused and instantiated multiple times, helping to build organized, maintainable software.[1]

A practical real-world example of modularity in OOP is a **Restaurant Management System** where different staff roles are modeled as separate classes but share common behavior through inheritance, promoting modular design and code reuse.[1]

## Real-World Example: Restaurant Staff Roles

Imagine a restaurant where various staff members work different shifts with different responsibilities such as waiting tables, cooking, or managing billing.

### Classes as Modules

- A **base class** `Staff` defines common properties and methods like `startShift()`, `endShift()`, and `performDuty()`.
- Specialized classes like `Waiter`, `Chef`, and `Cashier` inherit from `Staff` and extend or modify behaviors for specific roles.

### Code Sketch

```java
class Staff {
    String name;
    void startShift() {
        System.out.println(name + " has started their shift.");
    }
    void endShift() {
        System.out.println(name + " has ended their shift.");
    }
    void performDuty() {
        System.out.println(name + " is performing general duties.");
    }
}

class Waiter extends Staff {
    void performDuty() {
        System.out.println(name + " is serving customers.");
    }
}

class Chef extends Staff {
    void performDuty() {
        System.out.println(name + " is preparing dishes.");
    }
}

class Cashier extends Staff {
    void performDuty() {
        System.out.println(name + " is managing the billing counter.");
    }
}
```

### Benefits

- **Modularity:** Each role is a separate module/class encapsulating its own behavior.
- **Reusability:** Common features are stored in `Staff`, reused by all subclasses.
- **Extensibility:** New roles can easily be added by extending `Staff`.
- **Maintainability:** Changes in shared behavior need to be made only in the base class.

### Usage Example

```java
Waiter w = new Waiter();
w.name = "Arjun";
w.startShift();
w.performDuty();
w.endShift();

Chef c = new Chef();
c.name = "Manoj";
c.startShift();
c.performDuty();
c.endShift();
```

This way, the restaurant management system cleanly separates concerns, encapsulates behaviors in logical modules, and reduces code duplication, illustrating modularity in OOP effectively.[1]

This modular approach mirrors many real-world software systems where complex operations are divided into manageable, reusable components, a core strength of OOP.[6][1]
